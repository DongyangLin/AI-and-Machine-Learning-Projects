#  Exploring Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction in Data Analysis

## Abstract:

This project investigates the application of clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction methods in data analysis. Implementing K-means and Soft K-means algorithms in Python using Numpy, we evaluate their performance on a diverse dataset with seven input features and three distinct labels. The project explores clustering effectiveness without label information, assesses the impact of setting K=10, and introduces non-local split-and-merge moves to enhance algorithmic accuracy. Additionally, dimensionality reduction techniques, PCA and Linear Autoencoder, are implemented to showcase their versatility.

## Introduction:

In the domain of data analysis, understanding patterns and extracting meaningful insights is paramount. This project focuses on exploring the capabilities of clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction methods across datasets with diverse characteristics. The implementation and evaluation of K-means and Soft K-means algorithms serve as foundational components in this exploration.

The primary objectives include assessing the performance of clustering algorithms without relying on label information, investigating the impact of increased clusters (K=10), and enhancing algorithmic accuracy through non-local split-and-merge moves. Additionally, dimensionality reduction techniques, namely PCA and Linear Autoencoder, are introduced to showcase their versatility in simplifying data representation.

## Problem Formulation:

The project addresses several key challenges inherent in data analysis:

1. **Clustering Analysis:** Evaluate the performance of K-means and Soft K-means clustering algorithms on datasets with diverse characteristics. Assess their effectiveness in uncovering patterns without using label information.

2. **Impact of Cluster Number:** Investigate the consequences of setting K=10 in both K-means and Soft K-means. Analyze the algorithms' ability to handle an increased number of clusters and differentiate finer distinctions within the dataset.

3. **Algorithm Enhancement:** Modify clustering algorithms by incorporating non-local split-and-merge moves. Observe the impact of these enhancements on clustering accuracy, particularly with a higher number of clusters.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Implement PCA and Linear Autoencoder to extract essential features and reconstruct original data. Showcase the potential of these methods in simplifying data representation across diverse datasets.

The project aims to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques, offering valuable implications for a broad range of data analysis scenarios.
